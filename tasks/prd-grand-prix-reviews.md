# Product Requirements Document: Grand Prix Reviews Page

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new page dedicated to displaying and collecting user reviews for a specific Formula 1 Grand Prix race. The initial implementation will focus on creating a single page for the "Austrian Grand Prix 2025". The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to read what others thought about the race and to share their own opinions and ratings.

## 2. Goals

- Implement a page that displays a list of reviews for the Austrian Grand Prix 2025.
- Provide a form for users to submit their own review and a 1-5 star rating.
- Use mock data to populate the initial list of reviews.
- Allow users to see their new review appear on the page immediately after submission (client-side).

## 3. User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to see a list of reviews for the Austrian Grand Prix 2025 so that I can understand public opinion about the race.
- **As a user,** I want to submit my own review and a 1-5 star rating for the race so that I can share my experience.
- **As a user,** I want to see all relevant details for a review, including the author's name, their rating, the review text, the submission date, and an avatar.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The page will be hardcoded for the **Austrian Grand Prix 2025**.
2.  A list of reviews, sourced from `src/lib/mock-data.ts`, will be displayed on the page.
3.  Each review item in the list must display:
    - Author's name
    - Author's avatar
    - Star rating (1-5 stars)
    - Review text
    - Submission date
4.  A form will be present on the page for submitting a new review.
5.  The review submission form must contain:
    - An input field for the user's name.
    - A textarea for the review text.
    - An interactive star rating input (1-5 stars).
    - A "Submit" button.
6.  Upon form submission, the new review shall be added to the top of the review list on the page. This update is client-side only.
7.  The submitted review does not need to persist and will disappear on page refresh.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Users will **not** be able to edit or delete their reviews in this version.
- Reviews will **not** be saved to a database or any persistent storage.
- The page will **only** be for the Austrian Grand Prix 2025. A system for viewing reviews for other races is out of scope for now.
- A full user authentication system is out of scope for this version, but the architecture should not prevent its future implementation.

## 6. Design & UI Considerations

- The page will use a **single-column layout**.
- The review submission form will be located at the **top** of the page, above the review list.
- The design must be **responsive**, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Placeholder images for avatars can be sourced from `https://picsum.photos/200` or similar.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Initial reviews will be loaded from the static `src/lib/mock-data.ts` file.
- State management for the list of reviews (including new submissions) will be handled on the client-side (e.g., using React state).

## 8. Success Metrics

- A functional page is delivered that meets all the functional requirements outlined above.
- A developer can use this document to implement the feature with minimal ambiguity.

## 9. Open Questions

- None at this time.
